# lxcenter-repo
Repo of all RPM's of Lxcenter.org

Temporary download link is still thier server:

http://66.160.179.101/download/update/

http://75.98.169.138/download/update/


Its better keeping all RPM's for further development.

My repo:

https://ip-television.ml/repo (sorry was what i found free for me to put the files in)

If you want to install it and test like i am doing please do it:

yum-config-manager --add-repo https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taidos/lxcenter-repo/master/lxcenter.repo

or

wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/taidos/lxcenter-repo/master/lxcenter.repo -O /etc/yum.repos.d/
